# copyline

So I had this big long list of links to follow at some point and was looking to migrate them into todoist todos. This required me to copy and paste each line. This script copies each line of a file to the clipboard one at a time, advancing with any character press in the terminal or after one second has passed. To anyone who reads the code: I am so, so sorry. 


Things you might have to do:

chmod +x script.sh

touch ~/hi.txt #PASTE YOUR FILE HERE

touch ~/temp.txt

./script.sh
